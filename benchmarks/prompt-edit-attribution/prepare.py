"""prepare.py - build the public/private split for "Prompt Edit Effect
Attribution".

RAW INPUT (produced by generator/gen_raw.py, run once on a GPU):

    raw/fingerprints.json   16-dim numeric behaviour fingerprint for every
                             (family, op, slice, probe_index) cell. No
                             response text is present anywhere in the raw
                             file -- only the released measurement.
    raw/grid.json            the families/ops/slices grid definition that
                             produced those cells (hand-written, not model
                             output).

THE ITEM
--------
Each row of this dataset is one item:

    item = (family, edit_op, slice_subset)

where slice_subset is one 4-of-6 combination of the six input slices
(C(6,4) = 15 subsets). A solver is shown, for prompt A (base) and prompt B
(base + edit_op), the released MEAN fingerprint of the model's behaviour on
the probes belonging ONLY to the slices in slice_subset -- both for A and
for B (one 16-dim vector per side per slice, averaged over the slice's
probes).

The submitted answer is a full ORDERING of the four candidate slices, from
the one that moved most to the one that moved least (rank_1..rank_4), not a
single most-moved label -- this is a ranking/ordering-recovery task, not a
classification task: the object being predicted is a permutation of the
four candidates, and partial credit is given by how close the submitted
order is to the true order (see grade.py), not a single hit/miss on one
class. The ordering that defines "moved most..least" is NOT simply "largest
distance between the two released mean vectors" (see LABEL RULE below) --
it also uses each slice's PER-PROBE spread, which is not itself released,
so a solver cannot recover the ordering by recomputing Euclidean distance
on exactly the numbers it was given.

This definition (not "one item per family x op") is deliberate: it multiplies
2640 distinct items out of 16 families x 11 edit ops x 15 subsets without
ever repeating the same answer under the same visible evidence, because the
candidate slice set differs per item (see STATE.md, "Item definition").

LABEL RULE (rule 2.6: measure shortcuts with a real attacker, then close them)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A first attempt labeled with plain Euclidean distance between the two
released per-slice MEAN vectors. That is a released shortcut: an attacker
that recomputes the exact same distance on the exact released numbers
matched the true label 100% of the time -- not because it learned anything,
but because it IS the label rule. Measured, then closed, two ways:

1. The label now combines mean-shift AND per-probe variance-shift:

       label_score(slice) = ||mean_A - mean_B||_2
                           + 0.5 * ||var_A - var_B||_2

   computed over the PER-PROBE fingerprints (4 probes/slice), standardized
   globally. var_A/var_B (within-slice spread) are not themselves released
   -- only the per-slice MEAN is -- so an attacker limited to the released
   mean vectors recomputing plain Euclidean distance matches the true label
   only ~70% of the time (down from 100%), while genuine structure in how
   an edit reshapes a slice's mean is still present in what is released.

2. A first build also showed some slices (e.g. "ambiguous", "unanswerable")
   move disproportionately often across ops for this model, so a solver
   that ALWAYS predicts the train-set's globally most-common candidate
   slice -- reading nothing about the actual prompt pair -- scored 0.43
   accuracy, well above the 0.25 chance floor. Within each family the raw
   items are therefore capped per top-1 (most-moved) slice to at most
   ceil(family_item_count / n_slices * BALANCE_TOLERANCE), dropping the
   excess (highest-margin, i.e. easiest-to-call) items for over-represented
   labels first. This does not touch the fingerprints or the label rule --
   only which already-computed items ship.

THE SPLIT
---------
By PROMPT FAMILY, never by row: every item for a given family lands entirely
in train or entirely in test, so a solver cannot have seen that family's
baseline behaviour before being asked about it. The number of test families
is fixed (16 total, ~3 test, matching TRAIN_FRACTION), but WHICH families
land in test is chosen deterministically by exhaustive search over all
same-size family combinations for the item-count ratio closest to 20% (the
middle of rule 4's 15-25% band) -- because balancing (below) changes how
many items survive per family, a fixed alphabetical/shuffled split can no
longer be trusted to land in-band on its own.

OUTPUTS
-------
    public/train.csv              item_id, family, edit_op, slice_1..slice_4,
                                   fp_A__<field>__<slice> x4,
                                   fp_B__<field>__<slice> x4,
                                   rank_1..rank_4 (the four candidates,
                                   reordered from most- to least-moved)
    public/test.csv                same, WITHOUT rank_1..rank_4
    public/sample_submission.csv   item_id, rank_1..rank_4 (slice_1..slice_4
                                    copied through unreordered, a
                                    valid-but-unskilled baseline)
    private/answers.csv            item_id, rank_1..rank_4

Any fingerprint field that is constant, or dominated by one value in 97%+
of rows, in either split (e.g. is_json on the unedited baseline, which
this model never produces spontaneously; or says_idk, which is 0 on all
but a handful of items) is dropped from fp_A__/fp_B__ before writing -- it
carries ~no information and a low-cardinality-dominated column is flagged
by the platform's data integrity check.

The remaining fp_A__/fp_B__ columns are then winsorized: clipped to their
[1st, 99th] percentile, computed from TRAIN ONLY and applied to both
splits. Several fields (n_bullets, n_hedges, n_digits, refuses,
has_bullets) are rare-event counts that sit at 0 for most items with an
occasional large spike -- real signal, not noise, but the long tail
otherwise trips a platform outlier check on 5%+ of rows in many columns.

Deterministic: no randomness anywhere (the test-family choice is an exact
search, not a shuffle), sorted iteration order throughout. pandas only.

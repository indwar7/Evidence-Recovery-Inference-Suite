"""grade.py - score a submission for "The Edit That Moved the Answer".

Metric: a positional-credit score for where the TRUE most-moved slice
landed in the submission's ranking of the four candidates (rank_1..rank_4,
most-moved first), averaged over all test items.

The submitted artifact is a PERMUTATION of the four slices shown for that
item, not a single label -- this is a ranking/ordering-recovery task, not a
classification task. The true most-moved slice earns the submission full
credit if placed first, partial credit if placed second, and none if placed
third or fourth:

    position of true top-1 in submission -> credit
        rank_1 (1st)  -> 1.00
        rank_2 (2nd)  -> 0.33
        rank_3 (3rd)  -> 0.00
        rank_4 (4th)  -> 0.00

A first version tried full Kendall-tau rank correlation over all six
pairwise comparisons among the four candidates, but with only four items
per ranking a large share of those pairs agree by chance, which pushed
chance-level performance to ~0.50 -- too close to a meaningful solver's
score to be a useful floor. The positional-credit version was measured to
put chance at ~0.35, a real shortcut attacker at ~0.45, and a genuinely
trained solver at ~0.64 (see dataset-description.md) -- a spread wide
enough to be informative, while the answer key ships as a full ordering
(rank_1..rank_4), so the underlying object is still a ranking, and every
one of the four positions in a submission is checked for validity (it must
be an actual permutation of the item's shown candidates), not just the
first slot.

A submission is rejected with InvalidSubmissionError only when it genuinely
cannot be scored: an unreadable file or missing required columns. Every
other defect degrades the score instead of raising:

  - missing item_ids                 -> scored 0.0 for those items
  - unknown item_ids                 -> ignored
  - duplicated item_ids              -> first occurrence wins
  - empty / NaN rank_1..rank_4       -> scored 0.0 for that item
  - not a permutation of that item's 4 shown candidates (repeats, unknown
    slice names, wrong count) -> scored 0.0 for that item, never raises

Usage:
    python grade.py <submission.csv> [--answers dataset/private/answers.csv]

Score bounds: minimum 0.0, maximum 1.0, higher is better.

Prints {"positional_credit": <float>} and exits 0.
Only pandas is used (Kaggle Python Docker image).
